name: image-prompt-generator
description: Generates optimized prompts for image generation and editing with OpenAI's GPT Image models (gpt-image-2). Use this skill WHENEVER the user wants to create images with AI, generate prompts for ChatGPT or DALL-E, needs help with logo generation, infographic, product photo, UI mockup, ad, realistic photo, educational image, image editing, style transfer, compositing, image translation, comic strip, children's book, merch, card, or any other type of visual. Also trigger when they say "I want to generate an image of", "help me create a prompt for an image", "I want to make a logo in ChatGPT", "how do I ask AI to generate X", or any variation about creating images with AI.

# Image Prompt Generator

Skill for generating structured and optimized prompts for OpenAI's GPT Image models, based on the official gpt-image-2 prompting guide.

## Usage Flow

1. **Identify the mode** (generation or editing — see below)
2. **Identify the image type** from the index
3. **Read the corresponding reference file**
4. **Ask elicitation questions** specific to that type
5. **Generate the final prompt** + recommended parameters

---

## Mode: Generation vs. Editing

**First of all, identify the mode:**

| Mode | When to use | What the user needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Generation** (text → image) | Create something from scratch, without a reference image | Nothing — just the prompt |
| **Editing** (text + image → image) | Modify, combine or transform an existing image | One or more input images |

> If the user has no input image → **Generation**
> If the user wants to change/combine images they already have → **Editing**

### ⚙️ Parameters and models

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| Which model to use, sizes, quality settings | `references/models.md` |
| General prompting principles | `references/fundamentals.md` |

---

## Universal elicitation questions

If the type is not yet clear, ask **at most 2 questions**:

1. **What do you want to create/modify?** (main object, scene or concept)
2. **Do you have a reference image to use as a base?** (determines whether it's generation or editing)

After identifying the type → read the correct file and ask the specific questions from there.

## Default output

Always deliver the result in this format:

```
📋 PROMPT
[full prompt here]

⚙️ RECOMMENDED PARAMETERS
- Model: gpt-image-2
- Mode: Generation / Editing
- Size: [e.g. 1024x1536]
- Quality: [low / medium / high]

💡 TIP
[short and relevant observation about this image type, if any]
```

## General principles (always apply)

Read `references/fundamentals.md` if you need guidance on prompt structure, specificity, composition, text in images, or iteration. For most cases, the specific files already have everything needed.
